## Description 
Visualize is a simple app designed to take the userâ€™s goals and transform them into a vision board. First, the app inspires the user by displaying an inspirational quote on the landing page using Best Quote API. Next, the user answers a series of questions designed to capture their vision, chooses the images that they wish to add to their vision board, and a vision board is created for the final product.
With a simple UI and the use of straightforward questions, the application is designed to help the user to focus on their goals and without any aesthetic distractions.

Visualize was created using the following:
* jQuery
* DOM manipulation
* Pexels API
* Best Quote API
* Bootstrap
* Local storage
* Google Fonts
* Font Awesome

[Visualize](https://marioreid.github.io/project-1/) is a vision board generator designed to give the user a pictorial representation of their goals.
